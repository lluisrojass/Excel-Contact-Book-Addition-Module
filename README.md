# Excel Contact Book Module

Code for a Java Swing Graphical User Interface Module which automates the addition of a person into a Microsoft Excel based Contact book. This Program implements the Apache POI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_POI) API to preform operations on the file. Program also contains a working error-handling class keeping Exceptions and possible quagmires at bay. I'm aware that not much can be said about the purpose for this program, truth be told I thought this would be a great project for me because I can learn a good bit and also automate my contact book.
