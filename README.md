# Excel Contact Book Module

Code for a Java Swing Graphical User Interface Module which automates the addition of a person into a Microsoft Excel based Contact book. This Program implements the [Apache POI API](https://poi.apache.org/) to preform operations on the file. Program also contains a working error-handling class keeping Exceptions and possible quagmires at bay. I'm aware that not much can be said about the usefulness of this program, this was my first project and it was meant to be more of a learning experience
